# automationPlayground
Test project focused entirely on my learning curve

The sole purpose of this project is to train variery of automation concepts either for UI testing /such as interaction with buttons, verifications, architecture, SELENIUM GRID etc... / or API interactions.

Planning to introduce some mock libraries and play around with them in general.
